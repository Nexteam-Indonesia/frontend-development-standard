# Languages

## Overview

This section contains styleguides for programming languages used within projects. Other times, it also outlines our considerations as to why we're using them. If you would like to add more languages into the styleguide, please read the [Adding New Languages](#adding-new-languages) section.

## Adding New Languages

To add a new language to our style guide, please follow these steps:

1. <b>Create a New Markdown File:</b> Create a new markdown file for the language you want to add. For example, if you are adding a style guide for Ruby, create a file named ruby.md in this directory.

2. <b>Define the Style Guide:</b> In the new markdown file, outline the style guide for writing code in the respective language. Include information on formatting conventions, naming conventions, code organization, and any other language-specific best practices we should follow.

3. <b>Link to the Table of Contents:</b> In the "Contents" section of this README, add a new row to the table for the new language, providing a link to the markdown file you created. Make sure to include a brief description of the language style guide.

4. <b>Review and Collaboration:</b> Share the new style guide with the team for review and collaboration. Encourage team members to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.

5. <b>Update the README:</b> Once the style guide is finalized and approved, update this README to remove the [TODO] placeholder and add a brief description of the new language section under the "Contents" table.

6. <b>Maintaining the Style Guide:</b> As our projects evolve, ensure that the style guides are kept up to date with any changes in coding standards or best practices for each language.

By following these steps, you can contribute to our growing library of language-specific style guides and help improve the overall code quality and consistency across our projects. Happy coding!
